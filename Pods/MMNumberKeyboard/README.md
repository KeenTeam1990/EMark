### From CocoaPods 
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like `MMNumberKeyboard` in your projects. First, add the following line to your [Podfile](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html):

```ruby
pod 'MMNumberKeyboard'
```

Second, install `MMNumberKeyboard` into your project:

```ruby
pod install
```

### From Carthage
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a dependency manager for Objective-C and Swift. Add the following line to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "matmartinez/MMNumberKeyboard"
```

The run `carthage update`.

## Usage

There is a sample Xcode project available. Just build & run. And profit.

Basically you instantiate your own keyboard view to use as an `.inputView` of your `UITextField`, `UITextView` or whatever view that supports text editing.

```objective-c
// Create and configure the keyboard.
MMNumberKeyboard *keyboard = [[MMNumberKeyboard alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectZero];
keyboard.allowsDecimalPoint = YES;
keyboard.delegate = self;

// Configure an example UITextField.
UITextField *textField = [[UITextField alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectZero];
textField.inputView = keyboard;
```

You can adopt the `MMNumberKeyboardDelegate` protocol to handle the return key or whether text should be inserted or not.
